        We are required by applicable federal and state law to maintain the
        privacy of your health information. We are also required to give you
        this Notice about our privacy practices, legal obligations, and your
        rights concerning your health information (“Protected Health
        Information” or “PHI”). We must follow the privacy practices that are
        described in this Notice (which may be amended from time to time). For
        more information about our privacy practices, or for additional copies
        of this Notice, please contact us using the information listed at the
        end of this Notice. I. USES AND DISCLOSURES OF PROTECTED HEALTH
        INFORMATION: A. Your PHI may be used and disclosed by the physician, our
        office staff and others outside of our offices that are involved in your
        care and treatment for the purpose of providing health care services to
        you, to pay your health care bills, to support the operation of the
        business, and any other use required by law. We may use and disclose PHI
        without your written authorization for certain purposes as described
        below. The examples provided in each category are not meant to be
        exhaustive, but instead are meant to describe the types of uses and
        disclosures that are permissible under federal and state law. 1.
        Treatment: We may use and disclose PHI in order to provide treatment to
        you. For example, we may use PHI including your medication history to
        diagnose, treat, and provide medical services to you. In addition, we
        may disclose PHI to other health care providers involved in your
        treatment. 2. Payment: Under federal law we may use or disclose PHI so
        that services you receive are appropriately billed to, and payment is
        collected from, your health plan. By way of example, we may disclose PHI
        to permit your health plan to take certain actions before it approves or
        pays for treatment services. Under Washington state law, release of PHI
        to health plans require an authorization provided by you to us or to
        your health plan. We may contact the Guarantor for your visit in order
        to obtain payment. 3. Health Care Operations: We may use or disclose
        your PHI in order to support our business activities. These activities
        include, but are not limited to business associates, quality assessment
        activities, internal investigations, performance reviews, and training
        employees. In addition, we will use a sign-in sheet at the registration
        desk where you will be asked to provide your name and date of birth. We
        may also call you by name in the waiting room when the physician is
        ready to see you. We may use or disclose your PHI to contact you to
        remind you of an appointment, to notify you of test results, to inform
        you of health-related services that may be of interest to you, and to
        check on your treatment, progress, and satisfaction with our services.
        4. Required or Permitted by Law: As required by Law, Public Health
        issues as required by law, Communicable Diseases, Health Oversight,
        Abuse or Neglect, Food and Drug Administration requirements, Legal
        proceedings, Law Enforcement, Coroners, Funeral Directors, Organ
        Donation, Research, Criminal Activity, Military Activity, National
        Security, Worker’s Compensation, Inmates, and other Required Uses and
        Disclosures. Under the law, we must make disclosures to you and when
        required by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human
        Services. B. Permissible Uses and Disclosures That May Be Made Without
        Your Authorization, But For Which You Have An Opportunity to Object. 1.
        Family and Other Persons Involved in Your Care. We may use or disclose
        health information to notify, or assist in the notification of
        (including identifying or locating) a family member, your personal
        representative or another person responsible for your care, of your
        location, your general condition, or death. If you are present, then
        prior to use or disclosure of your health information, we will provide
        you with an opportunity to object to such uses or disclosures. In the
        event of your incapacity or emergency circumstances, we will disclose
        health information based on a determination using our professional
        judgment disclosing only health information that is directly relevant to
        the person’s involvement in your healthcare. We will also use our
        professional judgment and our experience to make reasonable inferences
        of your best interest in allowing a person to pick up filled
        prescriptions, medical supplies, x-rays, or other similar forms of
        health information.
